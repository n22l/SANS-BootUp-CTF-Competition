# SANS-BootUp-CTF-Competition
This Capture the Flag (CTF) competition required participants to use a variety of cybersecurity techniques, including network forensics, steganography, and file analysis, to solve complex puzzles. Tasks involved dissecting network packets, cracking encrypted files, and exploiting vulnerabilities in running services. Participants demonstrated their ability to detect hidden information, brute force credentials, and navigate through security flaws like buffer overflows, showcasing a comprehensive understanding of cybersecurity principles.


## Cybersecurity Skills with Tools Used in the CTF Competition

- **DNS Analysis**: Identifying flags in DNS queries and analyzing requests in packet captures using Wireshark.
- **Network Service Exploitation**: Connecting to services via SSH or custom ports and brute-forcing with tools like Hydra and scanning services with Nmap.
- **Password Cracking**: Cracking passwords using John the Ripper and wordlists.
- **Steganography**: Extracting hidden information from image files using tools like steghide, binwalk, and exiftool.
- **Buffer Overflow**: Exploiting vulnerabilities through pattern generation and EIP analysis.
- **File Analysis**: Uncovering hidden data using binwalk, strings, and other analysis tools.
